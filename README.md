# shoptrack-backend-v2
A backend API for ShopTrack rebuilt with Flask, SQLAlchemy ORM, and a layered architecture (models → repositories → services → API). This project is a refactor of the original ShopTrack backend, which used raw SQL queries. The new design introduces a clean separation of concerns, better maintainability, and testability.
